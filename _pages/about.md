Hi! I'm Shreyas Pimpalgaonkar. I'm a graduate student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. I'm interested in Machine Learning and Robotics. Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](lerrelpinto.com) on developing world models to scale and speed up robot learning. I'm also working with [Prof. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/) on improving the mathematical capabilities of large language models. In the past, I have worked with amazing professors [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/), [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/) and [Prof. Bhaskaran Raman](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~br/). 

I have also been interested in the financial markets and have worked as a quantitative research intern at [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/). Before my Masters, I worked as a quantitative researcher and developer at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), where I worked with [Jiantao Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiantao-wang-2127333/) and [Bhargav Srirangam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhargav-srirangam-a33a683/).
